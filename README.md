# PortfolioPage

Simple portfolio page using HTML and CSS. Currently updating with ReactJS.

ReactBootstrap used to create a Grid, Row, and Col, so text and photo appear side-by-side. CSS @keyframes used to make photo fade-in. Opacity of the content is set to 0 on page load, then 1 the first time the user clicks.

Areas for improvement: make the text fade-in and fade-out each time the user clicks using ReactCSSTransitionGroup
